/**
  * Implementation of timed events "moving window" counter that supports querying in the past.
  * We optimize performance via "checkpointing".
  *
  * Implementation remarks:
  * 1. All time values are Long and we interpret them as microseconds.
  * 2. "Naive" implementation of throughput calculation would be slower (always need to count beeps over the moving window)
  * but way simpler and also more precise. Here we sacrifice simplicity and accuracy for performance.
  * 3. We divide the time axis into intervals of length equal to resolution. Every interval corresponds to one checkpoint.
  * 4. Moving window contains a fixed number of intervals.
  * 5. Circular buffer is used to accumulate and count beeps in the "moving window".
  *
  * @param windowSize size of the "moving average" time window; must be a multiple of resolution
  * @param resolution how frequent are checkpoints (smaller value = more accuracy)
