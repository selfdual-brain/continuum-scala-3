/**
  * Conceptually, a SimulationEngine instance is a running simulation experiment. Technically - it is just an iterator of events.
  * Simulation engine assigns subsequent numbers to every emitted event and this number is called "step id". Some additional methods
  * here provide access to simulated time metrics.
  *
  * Caution: pay attention with distinguishing simulation time and wall-clock time.
  * For simulation time we use types SimTimepoint (for representing points in time continuum) and TimeDelta (for representing
  * amounts of time). Usually this is the "time" showing up in the API. Simulated time has "1 microsecond" resolution.
  * That said, simulated time is just a Long value. SimTimepoint and TimeDelta are just wrappers for Long.
  * For wall-clock time we usually use milliseconds (as received from System.currentTimeMillis).
  *
  * @tparam A type of agent identifiers
